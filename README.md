# AtomChromaKeyboardVimAddOn
Testing ground for an Atom addon that works with vim-mode to enable Razor Chroma SDK keyboard lighting.

This is a proof of concept.  This addon proves JS can call C++ in an AddOn created for [Atom](https://atom.io/).  

#Setup

- At the command line execute "node hello"

####Expected result  

> "Hello World!About to modify keyboard.Done!here is some output."

The final section, "here is some output", proves JS can create output generated by C++.

Currently the program is broken.  In hello.cc:

CreateKeyboardCustomGridEffects(Grid, nullptr);

is throwing an unknown type of exception.  I do not know how to find the type of exception thrown and I cannot obtain any information on why the exception is being thrown.
